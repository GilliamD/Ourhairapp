# Our Hair App

This repository holds our group capstone group project for Digital Crafts. Near the end of our 16-week course, we were instructed to put all of our newly acquired knowledge to the test by creating a website. We chose to go with a site where a user can sign up and log into their account where they will be asked a few questions about their hair type. From there, You can keep a log of if and when your hair was last dyed as well as upload pictures of your hair from the last time it was cut or dyed and what your dream hair would be. This site would help salons and clients with communicating and would save them both time.

## Collaboration Notes

- We worked together through Github and would push and pull our changes. There were quite a few merge conflicts but we were able to fix any issues that arose.

- Firebase was something new we've never used before so it was an interesting challenge. We had a limited time frame to learn how to use this for our database but we were able to successfully incorporate it into our project.

- As a group, we divided up work between ourselves and helped each other when we got stuck. It was a great way to practice communication and also how to handle a situation where members had conflicting ideas. Through compromise or alternate solutions, we were able to come to a conclusion that we were all satisfied with.
